A haskell event manager for uzbl, in progress.

Almost all the configuration is hard-coded (kinda like xmonad), so you'll have
to do a lot of editing of haskell if you wanted to make this do what you want.
Of course, if you're interested in such a thing, you're probably just looking
for a template to get started with anyway, in which case this should do you
fine.

It also relies on some features in my uzbl fork (but not many).
